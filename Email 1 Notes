== Player ==
Spotted by enemy
- The player should be notified in some manner in debug outlog and with preferably visual feedback.

Hidden Status
- Enemies should be able to telegraph their vision (ideally with visual representation) so that the player knows they're hidden behind an object.

Sound/Sneak
- The ability to sneak or sprint, affecting the range at which enemies detect the player.


== Guns & Game Objects ==
Weapons
- Any representation of a projectile based firing system, i.e sticks and stones.

Inventory System
- Player should start with 2 template weapons in their inventory/attached, with the ability to swap weapons.
  The player should only have one weapon equipped at a time with the ability to swap them. 
  They don't need any inventory system outside a counter for grenades.

Scenery Objects
- Basic, but easily identifiable 


== Enemies ==
Enemy Movement
- Preferably the enemy patrols a designated route.
  “I'm not too sure what enemies communicating with each-other entails. I'm assuming this output might be so that enemies don't intersect in patrol routes. In that sense there'd probably be an enemy patrol manager.”

Enemy Damage
- “How you represent enemies being "defeated" is up to you. As long as they change state when being hit by a projectile that'll work! Having some kind of "health" or "stun resistance" system would work here.”
